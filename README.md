# Swiss Bank Notes Counterfeit Detection
Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook focused on the analysis of Swiss Bank Notes. In this notebook, we will explore and examine various features of Swiss banknotes to gain insights and potentially detect patterns or anomalies related to their authenticity.

Swiss banknotes are renowned for their high quality and security features, which make them resistant to counterfeiting. However, it is essential to continually assess and improve the methods used to verify their authenticity, as counterfeiters become increasingly sophisticated in their techniques.

In the given notebook I've used clustering to determine Fake and Authentic Currency.
